            <p>Amazon.com, Inc.[1] (/ˈæməzɒn/ AM-ə-zon, UK also /ˈæməzən/ AM-ə-zən) is an American multinational
                technology company focusing on e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and
                artificial intelligence. It has been often referred to as "one of the most influential economic and
                cultural forces in the world",[5] and is often regarded as one of the world's most valuable brands.[6]
                It is considered to be one of the Big Five American technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent
                company of Google), Apple, Meta and Microsoft.

                Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[7] on July 5, 1994. Initially
                an online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories, a strategy that
                has earned it the moniker The Everything Store.[8] It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web
                Services (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), and Amazon
                Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods
                Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially increased its
                footprint as a physical retailer.[9]</p>

                    a taste. There’s no going back. Before you met me I was alright but things were kinda heavy. Heavy
